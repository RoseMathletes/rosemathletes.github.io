    <h2>What is Rose Mathletes? A message from the CEO:</h2>
    <p>It all originated in a class named R7G.
         I remember our teacher would get the people who finished our math assignments early
          (me included, and it was always the same people for some reason) and give us hard questions to keep us busy.
        Our teacher started calling us mathletes, which inspired me to make a logo (because why not don't judge me). Next things next and we have a new math assignment to
    create a circles "textbook page". I may or may not of gone overboard and completely overdone it in Google Docs. Next thing you know and we're creating a website and 
worksheets. </p>
